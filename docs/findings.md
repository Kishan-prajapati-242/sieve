# Findings

Diagnosed bugs, one entry each, newest last: symptom, how it was found,
root cause, fix, verified before/after. "How it was found" is the
load-bearing line — it records which instrument caught what the tests
missed, which is usually the real lesson.

## 2026-07-29: Exhausted slices bought a page just to throw it away

**Symptom:** a `--limit 5` smoke run fetched 5 works for 64 credits.
Expected ~32: two 1-credit concept pages plus three 10-credit search pages.

**How it was found:** credit instrumentation, not a test. The first live
run of the per-query credit report (added that same day to explain a
~790-credit reconciliation gap) showed every query costing exactly double
its predicted spend — nlp-concept 4 credits for 2 works, each specialty
20 credits for 1 work. The doubling pattern pointed straight at a
paid-request leak; all 55 tests were green throughout.

**Root cause:** the slice-budget check sat at the top of the work loop,
which means it ran when the page generator *resumed*. With
`per_page == slice_budget` the generator had already drained its page, so
resuming it fetched — and was billed for — the next page, whose works were
then discarded by the break. Every budget-exhausted slice paid for exactly
one unread page; at 10 credits per search page across 55 slices, the run
cost double.

**Fix:** check the budget after storing each work, so the loop breaks
before the generator can resume (commit `73391c3`). Regression test:
`test_exhausted_budget_never_fetches_the_next_page` counts requests at the
transport and asserts a one-work budget makes exactly one request.

**Verified before/after:** identical `--limit 5` runs: 64 credits before,
32 after — both reconciling exactly with the server's `credits_remaining`
delta (9055→8991, then 8991→8959).
